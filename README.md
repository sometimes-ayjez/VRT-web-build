# Virtual Ray Tracer Web Build

Virtual Ray Tracer is an educational application aimed at helping Computer Graphics students better understant ray tracing in an interactive manner. The application was created by Chris van Wezel and Willard Verschoore for their Computing Science Bachelor's degree programme at the University of Groningen.
As part of my Bachelor Honour's project, I added further functionality to VRT in the form of the 'Algorithm' panel, which shows and highlights the ray tracing steps as they are performed.
